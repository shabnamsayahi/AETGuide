# ArtsandEntertainmentTechnologyGuide(AET GUIDE)
Whether you're an incoming freshman or a graduating senior majoring in AET, at some point 
you felt uncertain if you are enrolling in the right courses. You've spent countless 
hours researching about each course while still not finding the right information. 
With AET being a fairly new program at UT, it can be difficult for students to have 
a full understanding of which emphasis to choose and what courses specifically lead to 
the right path. AET Guide helps students access the information they need in a few simple 
clicks, eliminating the headache of searching for hours. AET Guide will sort out all AET 
courses in specific categories so that users can choose the right emphasis as well as the 
right courses matching their specialization.
